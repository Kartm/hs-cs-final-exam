# hs-it-final-exam

#### My preperations for the High School Final IT Exam (so-called "Matura").

I'm convinced that the best way to study something IT-related is to use it in practice. Also, I know exactly what to train thanks to the following roadmap :)

As Aristotle said:

> For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.
