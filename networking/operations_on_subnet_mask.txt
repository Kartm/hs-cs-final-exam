Host IP address
192.168.1.145

Subnet mask
255.255.255.128 or /25

---------------------

1. calculating the network address

a) convert the host IP address and the subnet mask to its binary representations
11000000101010000000000110010001
11111111111111111111111110000000
b) operation AND (multiply each column)
11000000101010000000000110000000 -> 192.168.1.128

192.168.1.128 is the network adress

2. calculating the network's broadcast address

a) convert the subnet mask to its binary representation and transform it using NOT operation
00000000.00000000.00000000.01111111 -> 0.0.0.127
b) add it to the network address
192.168.1.128
+   0.0.0.127
=192.168.1.255

192.168.1.255 is the network's broadcast adress

3. calculating the number of hosts in the network
2^(amount of zeroes in the mask) - 2
2^7-2=126

4. addresses of the first and last hosts in the network
network address: 192.168.1.128
the first host: 192.168.1.129

broadcast address: 192.168.1.255
the last host: 192.168.1.254
